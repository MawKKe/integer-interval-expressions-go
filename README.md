# integer-interval-expressions-go
A Go library for parsing integer interval expressions such as `1,3-5,7-`

These kinds of expressions are commonly seen in application contexts such as page selectors
in print dialogs, or field selector in the CLI `cut` tool, and so on. This library
provides support for parsing and utilizing such expressions in wide variety of
application contexts.

Internally, the library parses an input string into an abstract logical expression,
which can be then evaluated with integer values to determine whether those
values lie in any of the specified intervals. The parsed expressions do not contain
any actual integer sequences, which allows for small memory usage and support for
infinite ranges

# Install

Add the library into your project:

```Shell
$ go get github.com/MawKKe/integer-interval-expressions-go@latest
```

then import the library in your application:

```Go
import (
    ...
    intervals "github.com/MawKKe/integer-interval-expressions-go"
    ...
)
```

# Usage

The library is quite simple to use. The primary function is `ParseExpression`
which takes a string and returns the parsed intervals expression as an abstract
`Expression` object:

```Go
inputString := "1,3-5,7-"
myExpr, err := intervals.ParseExpression(inputString)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("error:", err)
    return
}
fmt.Println("got valid expression:", myExpr)
```

Now you can evaluate the expression with various values:

```Go
myExpr.Matches(1) // == true
myExpr.Matches(2) // == false
myExpr.Matches(3) // == true
myExpr.Matches(4) // == true
myExpr.Matches(6) // == false
myExpr.Matches(7) // == true
myExpr.Matches(8) // == true
myExpr.Matches(9) // == true, is so for all values >=7
```
As you see, the expression evaluates to true only on the specified integer
intervals.

**NOTE**: The `ParseExpression()` is merely a convenience function, while the
actual work is performed by `ParseExpressionWithOptions()`. The difference is
that the latter accepts a `ParseOptions` struct in addition to the input
string; the options can be used for adjusting the operation of the parser to
suit your needs. See the `go doc` documentation for more information. You may
also be interested in the example and test functions in `expr_test.go`

Thats pretty much all there is to it. How you actually use this functionality
is up to you.  A typical use case is to iterate your application data entries
and check each one against the expression:

```Go
for _, page := range MyDocument.Pages {
    if myExpr.Matches(page.Number){
        PrintPage(page)
    }
}
```
etc.

## Syntax

An intervals expression consists of sequence of individual subexpressions.

A subexpression describes a continuous range of integral values (i.e an
interval).  A single subexpression string contains one of the following:

- an single integer, for example `1`: only the value 1.

- an integer, a dash, and another integer, for example `3-5`: values 3,4 and 5.

- an integer and a dash, for example `7-`: denotes all integers from 7 to
  infinity (i.e 7,8,9,...)

The intervals expression is consists of subexpressions joined by a delimiter
character.  By default, a comma (`","`) is used as the delimiter (although a
custom delimiter can be specified via the `ParseOptions` structure). For
example, the expression `1,3-5,7-` can be understood to contain three
subexpressions: `1`, `3-5` and `7-`.  Note that the interval expression
string does not need to contain any subexpressions, which means that `""` and
`",,,,"` are valid inputs. However, both of these parse into an `Expression`
structure containing 0 subexpressions and are, as such, rather useless.

Semantically, a single subexpression is a predicate, and combining multiple
predicates denotes a logical disjunction. The above expression thus states that
we have three predicates and an overall expression:

    func a(x int) { return x == 1 }             // "1"
    func b(x int) { return x >= 3 && x <= 5 }   // "3-5"
    func c(x int) { return x >= 7 }             // "7-"
    func expr(x int) { return a(x) || b(x) || c(x) }

(However note that in the library internals the expressions are not actually
represented this way.)

**NOTE**: For now, the library does not support parsing expressions with spaces
inside subexpressions, or between the subexpressions and delimiters. This may
change in future version.

## Optimization
The expression parser will happily process an input containing duplicate or
overlapping subexpressions. Likewise, the order of subexpressions is irrelevant
to the parser. However, poorly constructed expressions may result in
unsatisfactory `Expression.Match` performance. To overcome such issues, the
`Expression` instance can be simplified via its `Normalize()` method. The
method sorts the subexpression ranges and merges overlapping ones, producing a
minimal set of subexpressions. The resulting new `Expression` should be
semantically equivalent to the original, while being more performant from practical
perspective. 

**NOTE**: The parser does not perform the normalization automatically, unless
`ParseOptions::PostProcessNormalize` is set to true.

**NOTE**: Normalization may significantly change how an `Expression` is 
represented in text form. See the documentation for `Expression.String()`

## De-serialization
An `Expression` object can be converted back to string form via the `String()`
method.  For non-normalized expressions the resulting string should match
closely the original expression string (omitting any superfluous whitespace).
With normalized expressions, the resulting string is unlikely to be anything
like the original input expression unless the original expression was already
in normal form (this is not a bug).
